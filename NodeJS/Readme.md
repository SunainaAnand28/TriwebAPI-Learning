# Node.js 

Welcome to my Node.js section! This section demonstrates my skills in building server-side applications using Node.js.

## Features

- **Server Setup**: Creating and configuring a Node.js server.
- **Middleware**: Implementing middleware for various purposes (e.g., logging, authentication).
- **Database Interaction**: Connecting to and performing operations on a database (e.g., MongoDB).

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to handle routing and middleware.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing and managing data (optional, based on your project requirements).
