# MERN Stack Internship Program at TriwebAPI
Welcome to the MERN Stack Internship Program at TriwebAPI! 
Hello! My name is Sunaina Anand, and this is my repository for the project that I am working on during my 6-month internship at TriWebAPI. This document will guide you through the setup, structure, and specifics of the project.

## Program Overview
* Proficiency in MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
* Experience in building and deploying full-stack web applications.
